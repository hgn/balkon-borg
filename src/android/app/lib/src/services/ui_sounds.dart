/// Systematic UI sounds (E8 follow-up, gen-sounds.py), a "second sense"
/// alongside `services/haptics.dart` — additive, never a replacement for the
/// haptic at the same call site. Wraps `audioplayers` behind
/// `Settings.uiSoundsEnabled` so every audible cue in the app goes through
/// one gate instead of scattered `AudioPlayer`/`AudioPool` calls that would
/// ignore the setting.
///
/// Grammar mirrors `haptics.dart`'s, mapped onto the WAVs under
/// `assets/audio/ui/`. The dividing line is **navigation vs. change**:
/// moving around the app is a click and nothing else, because it happens
/// too often and too fast for anything with a tail; changing what the
/// hardware is actually doing may occasionally get a droid's opinion.
/// - `blip` — the `selectionClick`/`lightImpact` counterpart: tabs, chips,
///   rows, cards. Uniform pick among the short clicks, no surprises ever.
/// - `confirm` — the "state-echo confirmation" counterpart to
///   `mediumImpact()` fired from `AppState._applyModeUpdate`, i.e. the
///   arbiter reporting back that COMMS really went from off to FM. Usually
///   a chirp, at `_droidChance` a burst of droid babble instead. Suppressed
///   for SENTRY submode changes (see `app_state.dart`) since those already
///   get `powerUp`/`powerDown` at the switch itself.
/// - `powerUp`/`powerDown` — the SENTRY arm/disarm switch, mirroring the
///   `heavyImpact`/`mediumImpact` split there but as one sound each way
///   (power-up.wav / power-down.wav).
/// - `pttDown`/`pttSent` — push-to-talk: press-down (ptt-click.wav, next to
///   `mediumImpact()`) and a real network send actually succeeding
///   (ptt-roger.wav) — not release-to-send itself, which is a gesture, not
///   an outcome.
/// - `error` — a failed talkdown send (`_stopAndSend`'s non-2xx/catch
///   branches). Uniform pick among the sad ones.
